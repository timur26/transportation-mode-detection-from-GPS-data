# Detecting public transport mobility from GPS data

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a post-processing technique that leverages individuals’ GPS sensor readings in order to understand users’ mobility patterns, with a specific focus on public transportation. 

Subsequently, we evaluate the impact ofvarious GPS related PETs on the algorithm’s performance to get an understanding of theresults’ usability.


## Description

This project was carried in collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Centre (SDSC). The work was carried out individually as part of the semester project that has to be completed during the Master's in Data Science at EPFL.
