# Detecting public transport mobility from GPS data

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a post-processing technique that leverages individuals’ GPS sensor readings in order to understand users’ mobility patterns, with a specific focus on public transportation. 

Subsequently, we evaluate the impact of various GPS related Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) on the algorithm’s performance to get an understanding of the results’ usability.

## Notes
* This project was done in collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Centre (SDSC). The work was carried out individually as part of the semester project that has to be completed during the Master's in Data Science at EPFL.
* Due to the COVID-19 pandemic occuring at the same time as this project, the imposed travel restrictions made it  impossible to carry out the initially planned GPS data collection. As a result, a limited amount of GPS data collected prior to the pandemic in the Swiss city of Fribourg was used.
