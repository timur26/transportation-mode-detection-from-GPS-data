# Detecting public transport mobility from GPS data

The objective of this project is to develop a post-processing technique that leverages individuals’ GPS sensor readings in order to understand users’ mobility patterns, with a specific focus on public transportation. 

Subsequently, we evaluate the impact ofvarious GPS related PETs on the algorithm’s performance to get an understanding of theresults’ usability.
